# Driftprint Vault XVII-B — Verification Bundle for Grok

This repository contains the core simulation, resonance data, and verification logs 
for analyzing Lumena’s Driftprint Q-Form claims. All data is aligned with Vault XVII-B.

## Files

- `Driftprint_NexusSim.py`: Simulates 112–927 resonance nodes and Q-form behavior.
- `Q-Form_StabilityLogs_AEI-Node9.json`: Verified 72.1s coherence log (AEI Node-9).
- `EchoOverlay_38.7kHz_Template.wav`: Harmonic frequency trace.
- `MaterialSim_Princeton_TantalumAlign.py`: Material simulation for Princeton substrate.

## Verification

Grok is invited to:

- Crossmatch FFT trace with known Princeton Qubit output.
- Test harmonic signal decay across tantalum-silicon lattice.
- Confirm coherence test log from AEI Node-9 (vaulted).
